Welcome to the Cyber Clippy badge competition!
We are so excited to bring this to you all, and here's how you can get your hands on one. check back often in the next week, we'll keep all the details fresh right here.

brought to you by Office of the CTO Maker Incubation Team at Microsoft.

### What is it?
Well, for starters, it's a badge! for #badgelife! 

This badge brings the World's most secure IoT device to the world's most hostile network and exposes it to the world's best hackers and makers for fun and prizes!!!

### Ok, but Why?
Well, we first want to have fun! 

We hypothesize that by participating in the Badgelife community it is a great way to engage with makers and hackers to listen and learn about what this community needs and how to enable them in the future. 

So in spirit of this desire, we came up with the crazy idea: What if we made our own badge, brought our own Azure sphere Controller, and created a community challenge where folks can learn how to hack an old school Altair 8800, what would happen?!?

### So What Happened?
in under 6 weeks,
- we scrounged up 50 Azure Spheres boards from this rock we call Earth!
- designed and manufactured 500 PCB badges in assorted colors
- added 50 AI and Cloud powered Altair 8800 emulators (8800 Retro-click)
- splatted over 50 32GB SD cards
- ordered over 250 standoffs
- shipped 50 5000MAh USB powerpacks
- **_over $168 value in each competition badge!_**

# WHAT'S THE PRIZE?
the first 5 people to complete the challenge get chance to win
**an ADAFRUIT LOBE KIT WITH A RASPBERRY PI 4!!!!**(https://aka.ms/defcon30/lobekit)
